## Who Am I?


I'm a Bachelor's degree holder in computer science and mathematics. I've been
coding for couple of years at work and in my spare time. I've worked on quite
a range of personal projects, to name a few:

* Self-improvement app to help Muslims pray on time: [Project AroundTheClock](https://github.com/othmanalikhan/project_aroundtheclock)
* A Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to solve captchas: [Project Captcha](https://github.com/othmanalikhan/project_captcha)
* Various Django webapps (e.g. Q&A webapp for 3,000 users): [Project Vote](https://github.com/othmanalikhan/project_vote)

Recently I've discovered a love for cyber security, so I've jumped down the rabbit hole. 
I've been exploring penetration testing, bug bounty, reverse engineering, and a bunch of other things too.
See my [Portfolio](/portfolio) for more detailed cyber security work I've done.
